This is experiment is being done in order to align d6-27 VacA hexamer average with d6-27 VacA in the presence of total heart lipid LUVs.  We want to do this in order to determine if there is any difference within the center of the oligomer which could suggest VacA is bound to the vesicles and 
difference mapping is perfomed, the legs of VacA  The reference based alignment was performed on 2014-02-10 and can be found in 
mdo2:/hd1/tasia/d6-27-heartLUVs/DATA/ref-align/
and details of the experiment can be found on page 77 of lab notebook 2.
*****d6-27 averages were generated by Scott Collier and they were located initially within his directory.  Unfortunately they were collected on the T12 at a magnification of 67,000.

Now you want to rescale your images.  To determine the rescale factor:
	(F20 ccd A/pixel)/(image plate A/pixel) = 4.48/3.5 = 1.28 
	*Note- you always want to scale down (which I did not do here)
	
	**Will need to covert from spider format to imagic

1.  Rescale in imagic:
	i <return>  (opens imagic)
	IMAGIC-COMMAND : zoom
 
  ** ROTATE (vs. Oct. 2005) welcomes you **
 
  
Option used for current IMAGIC command             : ZOOM
Input file, image loc#s                            : d6-27
Output file, image loc#s                           : d6-27_spi
Zoom factors (X,Y) (0.1-10.0)                      : 1.28,1.28

	*Note: ALWAYS change the output file name so that you don't overwrite the previous file*
You should now have a d6-27_spi.img and d6-27_spi.hed file in your stacks directory.

2.  Now you need to pad your files that they will be the same size as what you picked your other files with (120 box size).  Do this in imagic:
	i <return>
	IMAGIC-COMMAND : pad-image
 
  ** SUBFILE (vs. 12-Aug-2008) welcomes you **
 
Input file, image loc#s                            :  d6-27_spi
Output file, image loc#s                           :  d6-27_rescale
 
Mode of operation:
  APERIODIC               CENTER
  GENERAL                 PAD_GENERAL
  LARGE_PAD               SMALL_PAD
  PERIODIC                SQUARE
  CHECKERS                FIXED_OVERLAP_CHECKERS
  BEST_CHECKERS
Please specify option [APERIODIC]                  : pad_gen
Output image dimensions X,Y (integers)             : 120,120
	
	*Note- ALWAYS change the name of your output file*
	
3.  Now convert to SPIDER format using em2em

mkdir create_stack
1. First the averages need to be translationally aligned with a "reference class average".
d6-27 VacA: mdo2:/hd1/tasia/d6-27-heartLUVs/DATA/diffmap/d6-27-soluble-refalign/ref001.mVa was copied to 
mdo2:/hd1/tasia/d6-27-heartLUVs/DATA/diffmap/create_stack/win/original
d6-27 VacA + LUVs: 
mdo2:/hd1/tasia/d6-27-heartLUVs/DATA/ref-align/cluster10/ref004.vac
was copied to 
mdo2:/hd1/tasia/d6-27-heartLUVs/DATA/diffmap/create_stack/win/original
To do this use cull_s.sc:
   a. create a "stack" containing each class average as a particle
      In this example: win_00001 = ref001.mVa (353 particles)
                       win_00002 = ref004.vac  (2229 particles)
 
 Create win directory
 Create 0001 directory within win directory
 Place "particles" in 0001


2. Once the two references have been combined into a stack we  will "align" it to a reference.  For this case the aligment was against the wt-Vac$
I copied wt-07 two times to create: ref001.vac and ref002.vac (a reference for each "particle" in the stack).  Then set the real aligment to align
two "references".  The alignment will not work, however the data002.vac stack that is generated will have all the class averages properly
translationaly aligned so that a comparision between each 2D projections can be made.
 
3. unstack data002.vac file (using b04.uns).  Rename the "particles" (actually averages) to d6-27_tavg01.vac and d6-27luv_tavg02.vac ("t" denotes translationally aligned)
to run b04.uns (before running you need to manually change number of particles in the stack in b04.uns):
>spider
ENTER PROJECT/DATA EXTENSION: uns/vac
OPERATION: b04

DIFFERENCE MAPPING
use b05.uns
	>spider
	>uns/vac
	>b05
